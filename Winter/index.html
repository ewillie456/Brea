			<p>This is the official page for Winter Born Artist. This page, is meant to be as a portfolio, 
			as well as a way for I myself to become more well known, 
			and possibly make money for college in the mean time. 
			This page is also intended to be able to show my artwork and skills with others, 
			and to build up my art skills, by asking other artists to possibly give any tips or tricks.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>Winter Born Artist is just a cover name for me, for online purposes. 
			And may become the name of the business, of which I intend to build in the future. 
			But my signature for all my art is my real name, which is Breanna D'Hondt. 
			For identity purposes, I shall not state my middle name.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, I am a 17 year old artist, who originates, and lives in the Greater Rochester area, 
			in New York State. I am currently enrolled in High school still, 
			and I am intending to go to College for my art, But in the meantime, 
			I shall be using this profile as my portfolio, and as a means to raise money through my art, 
			so that I can save up for college. I ask that with the help of the community, and others, 
			you can all help me to reach my goal. </p>
			<p>My goal of course is to attend a 4 year college in the Fine Arts, preferably Alfred University, 
			Yale, Rhode Island School of Design, or even RIT-(for Photography). Not only that, 
			but I plan to sell some of my art, for other reasons aside from college, such as to buy more supplies,
			and so that I can afford to some day buy a better camera,(aside from the one on my phone) 
			to build up my photography portion of my portfolio, and so that I have it for college.</p>
			<p>Yet again in order to fulfill these set goals of mine, 
			I need the help of those of you that come across this page.</p>
